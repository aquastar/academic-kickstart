I will join Computer Science and Engineering Department of Mississippi State University in Fall 2020. Before joining MSU, I have been working as research assistant at Virginia Tech under the supervision of Chang-Tien Lu. My Master Degree is obtained from Peking University and a B.S. from Huazhong University of Science and Technology respectively. I received an outstanding contribution award from Toyota Research North America in 2016. My research focuses on graph mining, spatial data mining, computational art, explainable AI and complex system.

**Ph.D. positions are available, see [here](/post/opening/).**
