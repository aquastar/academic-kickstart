Spectal graph theory has been introduced into deep learning in recent years, which boost the research of graph neural networks. However, the pros, cons and suitable scenarios are unclear since there existing many spectral based method. In this research, we aims to answuer the question "which graph neural network is most sutiable on which type of data?"
