Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem is a fundamental problem in computer science and the core of many real-world applications such as hardware and software design. However, its solving or estimating hardness of SAT is NP-hard. We are seeking for a series of a methodology by deep learning to significantly accelerate its solving and estimation.
